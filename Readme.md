# Cholera Project Repository: CAN Fellow Initiative

## Welcome

Greetings! You've arrived at the official repository for the CAN Fellow Cholera Project. This collaborative effort aims to leverage data analysis for insightful exploration into cholera research. We appreciate your interest and participation in this project.

## Repository Access

To begin, we invite you to clone the repository or download it directly to your computer. This can be accomplished by visiting our GitHub page at [https://github.com/gbganalyst/Cholera-Project](https://github.com/gbganalyst/Cholera-Project) or by downloading the repository archive from [this link](https://github.com/gbganalyst/Cholera-Project/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Once downloaded, unzip the file on your local machine.

## Data Acquisition

The project's data sets are crucial for our analysis. You can access them through our shared [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p-DpLyA0JgErvGvvr98xKFulknvDKW3E?usp=drive_link). Please download the `Cholera-Project-Data`, unzip it, and place the `Vector-Layers` and `Raster-Layers` directories within the `Cholera-Project-main` directory on your computer.

## Development Environment

This project utilizes Python and R as its core programming languages. To ensure compatibility and ease of use, we recommend the following installations:

- **Anaconda**: A comprehensive Python distribution, equipped with a vast library of data science packages. Download from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

- **R and RStudio**: Essential tools for R programming. Download R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.3.2-win.exe) and RStudio from [RStudio Download](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/windows/RStudio-2023.12.1-402.exe).

## Executing Project Scripts

### Python Analysis

The Python component of our project is developed in Jupyter Lab Notebook. Open `Python-Project-Script.ipynb` within Jupyter Lab and execute the code blocks sequentially. Instructions within the notebook will guide you on transitioning to R for further analysis.

### R Analysis

For the R portion, initiate the `Cholera Project.Rproj` file to open the project in RStudio. Subsequently, load the `R-Project-Script.R` script file containing our R code for analysis.
