# Project Repository

Visit the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p-DpLyA0JgErvGvvr98xKFulknvDKW3E?usp=drive_link) and download all the directory in it.

Unzip the files and put it in the **Cholera-Project** directory.

We used both Python and R programming languages for this project. 

Please open the Jupyter Lab Notebook file, `Project Script.ipynb`, and run the codes in it.
